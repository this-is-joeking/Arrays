# Self Evaluation
###### Confidence
I feel confident with the content that was reviewed today, a lot of this is somewhat familiar which helps quite a bit.

###### Additional learning
I want to review the ruby documentation on arrays further, to get more info on arrays and see additional methods

###### Questions
I'm going to try and find this on the ruby documentation, but a questions I have is how would you go about moving an element from one array to another. Hopefully I will find a method for this, I imagine it is a common enough task that code needs to accomplish.
